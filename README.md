### Really relevant information 👨🏻‍💻
At 16yrs I became the most active contributor in the Italian Hackintosh Community. Spent 3 years rewriting kexts (drivers) and boot configs to force macOS onto custom non-Apple hardware. Open-sourced everything here. This project thought me at a young age not only how to write code but how to persist overtime when things don't go as planned. I thing there was never a project I failed to create so many times and always reattempted like Hackintoshes. 

Thanks to my mum and family for not having just bought me a mac. Sorry Apple if you're reading this.
